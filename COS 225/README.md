## Object-Oriented Design and Data Structures

This directory contains Java programs from my second semester as a Freshman in college.

Looking back at this code, it is a real mess and not code I am proud of. I hope to one day go back through and refactor probably everything and also finish assignment 11. For now though, there are only really sample outputs in each subdirectory that illustrate how the programs work.
