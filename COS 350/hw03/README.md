## The main problem
JJ has reached the sharky sea of sinking slides. The sea has numerous
small islands, connected by slides. Each slide connects two islands. The slides are barely
afloat. Swimming is not an option due to sharks, so the only way to travel is using the slides.
By zipping across a slide quickly, JJ can traverse it, but only once because it sinks to the
bottom of the sea immediately upon such use. At the middle of each slide is a precious jewel.
The main task is figuring out the maximum number of jewels that JJ can collect without
getting stranded, and returning to the starting position. The input specifies JJâ€™s starting
position and the configuration of slides and islands. The desired output is a sequence of
islands and slides that JJ can visit in the order provided to return to the initial position and
collecting as many jewels as possible. (There should be no solution that allows JJ to collect
more jewels.)
