## The main problem
JJ has reached the circular chamber of columns and must use a specific
arrangment of three jewels and a lamp to summon help from the jacketed justice
by shining the JJ sign into the sky. This circular chamber has a number of
columns. Each column has a fixed height but is mounted on a circular track,
centered on the chamber's center, that allows it to be moved to any position
on that track. No two columns share a track and the tracks are separated well
enough to avoid any interference when moving columns. The lamp and the three
jewels, ruby, garnet, and beryl, must be placed on separate columns so that 
they form a straight line, in the listed order, that points above the horizon in
the direction away from the lamp. The main task is figuring out which columns
to use for the lamp and the ruby, garnet, and beryl jewels in order to produce 
the required straight-line arrangement. The input is the collection of pairs, 
with each pair denoting the radius of a columns circular track and that column's
height. The desired output is a list of all 4-tuples of columns that satisfy the
requirements.
