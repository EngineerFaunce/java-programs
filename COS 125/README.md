## Introduction to Problem Solving using Computer Programming
This directory contains coding assignments for an introductory Java course I took. Each assignment contains a `README.md` that gives a brief description of what the program does along with sample outputs.

Since this was my first year with programming don't expect anything too crazy. I've begun going back through and improving bits and pieces of code.

## Notice
As of right now assignment(s) 10 and 11 are incomplete, but I plan to come back and finish them eventually.
- [x] Assignment 10
- [ ] Assignment 11
