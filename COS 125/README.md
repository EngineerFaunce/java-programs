## Introduction to Problem Solving using Computer Programming
This directory contains java programs from an introductory programming course I took. Each assignment contains a `README.md` that gives a brief description of what the program does along with sample outputs.

Since this was my first year with programming don't expect anything too crazy.

## Notice
As of right now assignment 11 is incomplete, but I plan to come back and finish it eventually.
