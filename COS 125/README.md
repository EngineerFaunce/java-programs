## Description
This subfolder contains Java assignment for the COS 125 course offered at UMO during my freshman year. Each assignment should contain a README.md that gives a brief description of what each program does.

Since this was my first year with programming don't expect anything too crazy. Looking back at a lot of these assignments now I only have to ask _"Why?"_ because with the experience I have now I would have taken a different approach to these problems.

## Important
As of right now assignment 10 and 11 are incomplete, but some day I'll revisit them to complete them.
