## Introduction to Problem Solving using Computer Programming
This directory contains Java coding assignments for the COS 125 course offered at UMO during my freshman year. Each assignment contains a README.md that gives a brief description of what the program accomplishes.

Since this was my first year with programming don't expect anything too crazy. Looking back at a lot of these assignments now I only have to ask _"Why?"_ because with the experience I have now I would have taken a different approach to these problems.

## Important
As of right now assignment 10 and 11 are incomplete, but some day I'll revisit them to complete them.
